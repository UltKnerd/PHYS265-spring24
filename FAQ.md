# FAQ....

1. Sometimes spyder is in a funky state, unhappy about lots of things, and only restarting helps.

   a. A line starting with "%%" was not seen by spyder, and is obviously an error. Yet it complained
      and claimed the file should be saved with the "ipy" extension

   b. And perhaps more?


2. Spyder would crash (on Windows) in plt.figure() with some 0x-hex code error. Downgrading (with conda)
   the spyder version might help.
