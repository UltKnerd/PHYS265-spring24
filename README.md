# PHYS265


In this class we will use python and git ...

## Python

We recommend installing anaconda python from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
Two common way to execute python codes are:

### 1. Jupyter Notebook / Lab

Interactive inside a browser

*a nice figure will go here*

### 2. Spyder

Interactive in a special GUI, much like MATLAB

*a nice figure will go here*

## Codes

Here are some places to find Open Source codes in Physics and Astronomy

1. Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL) :  https://ascl.net

2. Journal for Open Source Software (JOSS):  https://joss.theoj.org/

3. Zenodo : https://zenodo.org/



## Software Carpentry

Also some self-guided and OS agnostic lessons on:

1. Unix shell (even on Windows) :  https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
2. Python : https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/
3. Git : https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/
 
## Offline documentation

The spyder tool we are using has excellent help on python: both syntax and API.
But if you want something in parallel:

* Zeal (for Linux)
* Dash (for Mac) - free alternatives are:  dasht and devbook
* XXX (for Windows)
